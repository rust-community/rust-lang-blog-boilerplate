# RustLang Blog Boilerplate

This is the boilerplate code that allows you to quickly setup a blog that looks like the [RustLang blog].
It can easily be run on [GitHub pages].

This project has been forked from the awesome [GitHub repo] of the [RustLang blog].

[RustLang blog]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/
[GitHub repo]: https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org
[GitHub pages]: https://pages.github.com/

## How to use it

- [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to your own github account
- [Clone your forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
- Edit the [_config.yml](_config.yml) file to add your own information
- Create a blog post in the _posts directory (or edit [the example blog post](2018-05-10-blog-boilerplate.md))
- [Add your files, commit and push](http://guides.railsgirls.com/github) so your modifications are saved on github.com
- [Setup github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Send me a link to your blog and your first article, I'd love to read it ! :)

A deeper guide on how to setup a jekyll blog can be found [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). I'll probably create one too if it helps.

The theme and layout can be found under `/_includes`, `/_layouts`, `/_sass`, and `/css`.

The favicon is [here](favicon.ico).
