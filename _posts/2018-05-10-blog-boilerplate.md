Here is a boilerplate you can modify to write your first blog post !

All of the [markdown rules](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) apply here.

For example, you can write something in *italic* like this, you can write in **bold** like that. 

# This is an h1 (big) title
## This title is a bit smaller
### This one is even more smaller etc.

Don't hesitate and visit https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ to get more information ! 

# The name of the file is important !
This will generate the url, and complete the blog post meta informations (Such as the date for example).

A relevant page name, which matches the title pretty well might help [Search Engine Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) (Making sure the post is well referenced on search engines)
