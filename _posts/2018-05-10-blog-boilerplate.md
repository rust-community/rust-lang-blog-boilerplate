Here is a boilerplate you can modify to write your first blog post!

All of the [markdown rules](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) apply here.

For example, you can write something in *italic* like this, you can write in **bold** like that.

# This is an h1 (big) title

## This title is a bit smaller

### This one is even more smaller etc.

Don't hesitate and visit [mastering-markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to get more information!

# The name of the file is important!
This will generate the url, and complete the blog post meta information (Such as the date for example).

A relevant page name, which matches the title pretty well might help [Search Engine Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) (Making sure the post is well referenced on search engines)
